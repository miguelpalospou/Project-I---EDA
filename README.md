## Hypothesis

### Some of the questions that we need to answer to create an effective campaign are:

### - When should they launch their campaign? Which quarters of the year could be good?
### - Should we segment it by gender or age?
### - Which activities were victims primarily doing prior to the attack?


### Columns we will be focusing on: Country, Year, Date, Age, Activity, Sex.
